# GoBike

This is the data analysis on San Francisco bay area Ford GoBike bikeshare company. The dataset was publicly available on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BigQuery was employed to investigate the dataset and develop the recommendations to increase the bike ridership.  

A few things that are interesting in this dataset   
1. Folium heatmap is powerful at geographical investigation and give an insight to geographical recommendations. 
2. Certain features such as commuting times, commuting stations from 1 million riderships between 2013 and 2016 were conveniently analyzed in GCP BigQuery in milliseconds. 
3. GCP has many public datasets that are interesting to explore.  

Please go directly to my recommendation summarized from GCP BigQuery analysis here.
